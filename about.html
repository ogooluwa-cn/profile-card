                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>Passionate frontend engineer with a deep understanding of modern web architectures and component-driven development. I specialize in crafting performant, accessible, and scalable user interfaces using React, Next.js, and Vue. With strong expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+), I focus on writing clean, testable code and building seamless user experiences.</p>
                <p>I'm constantly exploring emerging frontend technologies, optimizing developer workflows, and contributing to open-source communities. Beyond code, I enjoy refining UI/UX details, improving accessibility, and mentoring fellow developers to build better products together.</p>

                <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Frontend development is not just about writing code - it's about creating experiences. The best interfaces are those that users don't even notice because they work so seamlessly. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. Every project is an opportunity to improve, and every challenge is a chance to grow.</p>
                <p>I'm excited to see how the web continues to evolve and how new technologies will enable us to build even more amazing experiences for users around the world.</p>
